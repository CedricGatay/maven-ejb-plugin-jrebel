Filter the deployment descriptor

  The EJB Plugin is capable of filtering the deployment descriptor
  (<<</META-INF/ejb-jar.xml>>>) for you, if you have the need to inject values
  into it during the build.

  <<Note:>> This feature was added in version 2.3 of the EJB Plugin.

  To filter the deployment descriptor add the following configuration to your
  POM:

+-------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-ejb-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <filterDeploymentDescriptor>true</filterDeploymentDescriptor>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
